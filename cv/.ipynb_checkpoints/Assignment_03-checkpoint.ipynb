    "    When we use a stride-2 convolution, we often increase the number of features because we’re decreasing the number of activations in the activation map by a factor of 4; we don’t want to decrease the capacity of a layer by too much at a time.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is one bias for each channel. (Sometimes channels are called features or filters when they are not input channels.) The output shape is 64x4x14x14, and this will therefore become the input shape to the next layer. The next layer, according to summary, has 296 parameters. Let’s ignore the batch axis to keep things simple. So for each of 14*14=196 locations we are multiplying 296-8=288 weights (ignoring the bias for simplicity), so that’s 196*288=56_448 multiplications at this layer. The next layer will have 7*7*(1168-16)=56_448 multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    What happened here is that our stride-2 convolution halved the grid size from 14x14 to 7x7, and we doubled the number of filters from 8 to 16, resulting in no overall change in the amount of computation. If we left the number of channels the same in each stride-2 layer, the amount of computation being done in the net would get less and less as it gets deeper. But we know that the deeper layers have to compute semantically rich features (such as eyes or fur), so we wouldn’t expect that doing less computation would make sense."
