# **1. Harvard Law School courses often have assigned seating to facilitate the “Socratic method.”
# Suppose that there are 100 first year Harvard Law students, and each takes two courses:
# Torts and Contracts. Both are held in the same lecture hall (which has 100 seats), and the
# seating is uniformly random and independent for the two courses.**

# **(a) Find the probability that no one has the same seat for both courses (exactly; you should
# leave your answer as a sum).**
